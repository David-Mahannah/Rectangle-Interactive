## Analysis
Although the user interface leaves something to be desired, the functionality of the site itself was my primary achievement. Integrating databases for users, posts, comments, and notifications really beefed up the complexity of this application from the back-end perspective. 
Looking back at my work from my current standing, I realize how far I've come in project management and programming design patterns. A huge lesson in this project was the effectiveness of the Open-Closed Principle. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openâ€“closed_principle. I struggled to implement new features to my code the longer I developed because I found myself rewriting code and modifying already existing code every update.
