## Introduction
Rectangle Interactive is a website I built primary throughout senior year of highschool and early into my freshman fall semester. The project was dropped after a while because It turned into more of a chore than a learning experience. Upon discovering this project more recently, I was inspired to pick it up again and hopefully bring some new and more effective methods to developing this site as a more experience developer.

## Technologies
- Python
- Flask
- SQL
- Sqlalchemy
- Javascript

## Setup
### Virtual Environments

On Windows: `source myprojectenv\Scripts\activate.bat`

On Unix and Mac OS: `source myprojectenv/bin/activate`

To install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Running the demo
After running:
`python wsgi.py`
The demo can be found at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser and should look as follows:

## Analysis
Although the user interface leaves something to be desired, the functionality of the site itself was my primary achievement. Integrating databases for users, posts, comments, and notifications really beefed up the complexity of this application from the back-end perspective. 
Looking back at my work from my current standing, I realize how far I've come in project management and programming design patterns. A huge lesson in this project was the effectiveness of the Open-Closed Principle. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openâ€“closed_principle. I struggled to implement new features to my code the longer I developed because I found myself rewriting code and modifying already existing code every update.
